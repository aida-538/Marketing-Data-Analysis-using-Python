# Python Marketing Analytics

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Python Marketing Analytics" project, where we delve into optimizing marketing campaigns and constructing a data-driven strategy. This project leverages the power of Python, specifically linear regression and correlation analysis, to unveil the most impactful marketing tactics influencing sales. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive ROI table for management to make informed decisions.

### Background of the Dataset

The dataset covers three types of hospital accounts: big, medium, and small hospitals. Sales data includes both organic and inorganic revenue generated through various marketing channels such as phone calls, emails, flyers, and sales visits.

## Data Loading and Quality Assurance

This section focuses on the initial steps of loading the dataset and ensuring data quality. Rigorous quality assurance processes are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and other anomalies for reliable analysis.

## Feature Enhancement and Engineering

A robust marketing strategy requires meticulous feature engineering. This section explores the process of augmenting and refining features to optimize the performance of machine learning models. Effective feature engineering is pivotal for the development of a powerful linear regression model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Insights

Moving forward, the project delves into exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis to extract insights into the impact of each marketing strategy on sales. The aim is to discern variations across different client types and pinpoint the most influential factors affecting sales.
